# OME 2024 NGFF Challenge

At the OME 2024 Community Meeting, a set of institutions with public data repositories (including JAX) devised a proof-of-concept challenge to push for a common usable specification and tooling around the OME-Zarr format. The goal is to develop a very minimal metadata standard for published data, a working version of what these public repositories would need from a file format, and a substantial corpus of data on that format. This corpus of data will be hosted from October to December of 2024 by individual participating institutions and can be queried from a centralized reference or any compatible viewer.

# JAX data contribution

JAX has committed to converting and hosting the public KOMP data in the new format. This repo contains the CSVs linking to that data.
